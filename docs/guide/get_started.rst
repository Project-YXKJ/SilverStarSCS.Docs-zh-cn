Getting Started
===============

This chapter gives an introduction on how to interact with this book.
This assumes you are reading an HTML book. The options and formatting will be different
for other output formats such as epub.

A book is organized into **chapters**. Each chapter is a separate page. Chapters can be 
nested into a hierarchy of sub-chapters. Typically, each chapter will be organized into
a series of **headings** to subdivide a chapter.

Navigation
==========

There are several methods for navigating through the chapters of a book.

The **sidebar** on the left provides a list of all chapters, and the right provides 
a list of all sub-chapters. Clicking on any of the chapter titles will load that page.

The sidebar may not automatically appear if the window is too narrow, particularly 
on mobile displays. In that situation, the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the 
top-left of the page can be pressed to open and close the sidebar.

The **arrow buttons** at the bottom of the page can be used to navigate to the previous
or the next chapter.

The **back to top** when the page scrolls upon can be used to navigate to the 
top of the page.

Top menu bar
============

The menu bar at the top of the page provides some icons for interacting with the book.

e.g. change dark/light mode.


Search
======

There is a search box above the left navigation bar.
